# InsightHealthDataScienceProject
This is my Insight Health Data Science Project for Summer 2018.

How do you find a good doctor for a second opinion?
To frame the problem further, how does someone with a cancer diagnosis find an expert doctor in their field.

To acquire data I:
1. I downloaded a list of medical oncologists from NYC and Boston from Healthgrades.com
2. Used NYMag and Boston Magazine to scrape list of "best" medical oncologists.
3. Used Pubmed and Scopus to get publication information for each doctor.
