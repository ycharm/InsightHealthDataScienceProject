# InsightHealthDataScienceProject
This is my Insight Health Data Science Project for Summer 2018.

How do you find a good doctor for a second opinion?
To frame the problem further, how does someone with a cancer diagnosis find an expert doctor in their field.

Data is acquired from 4 sources:
1. Healthgrades.com: Medical Oncologists in NYC
2. NY Magazine: Best Medical Oncologists in NYC
3. Pubmed.gov: Publications of all doctors in my Data
4. Scopus: Number of citations for each of these publications
